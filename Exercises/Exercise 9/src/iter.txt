.into_iter() = move, returns an iterator from a value, type iterator which can be any of T, &T or &mut T
    * Used if you need a new owner to have the data

.iter() = borrow, returns an iterator of slices, type &T
    * Used if you just want to read the data

.iter_mut() = mut borrow, returns an iterator that is mutable, type &mut T
    * Used if you want to modify the data

.drain() = move, returns an iterator from a value, type iterator which can be any of T, &T or &mut T
    * Used similar to into_iter() except when used doesnt delete the previous vector only empties iter
    * so that previous vec can still be used
